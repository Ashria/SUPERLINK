       ans: "Superlink offers real name digital IDs as blockchain domains. We believe firstname.lastname (e.g., sarah.chen) is the cleanest, simplest address possible. It‚Äôs one address for everything in your digital world.."},
    { id: 2, 
      name: "Sophia Turnerr",
      question:"How is this different from a normal domain?",
       ans: "Superlink names are blockchain domains. That means they have incredible new potential such as being one address for your digital wallet, website, email, and username. It will take time for that functionality to emerge. Today, we're offering the ability to claim your name and join the community.",},

Today we can be whoever we want to be online from ‚Äònoobmaster73‚Äô to ‚Äòbrian.eth‚Äô, ‚ÄòManUSusie78@hotmail.com‚Äô or 'Dave' on Instagram.
<br />
<br />

They all show a part of us, but none of them shows the real us. They are each a side of ourselves that live in different parts of the internet, none of which we truly own.
<br />
<br />

We believe there‚Äôs a simpler way to be yourself online, and all it takes is your real name.
<br />
<br />

That‚Äôs why we created Superlink, a universal address that represents you online - all using just your first and last name.
<br />
<br />

In today's rapidly evolving world, your real name is more than a name - it's your true identity, your brand, your calling card and your livelihood.

<br /><br />

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being ‚Äònoobmaster,' but sometimes, people need to find the real you.

<br /><br />

Suplink - own the real you.</p>
